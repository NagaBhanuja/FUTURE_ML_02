TELCO CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT

üéØ Project Goal

This project implements a Machine Learning solution to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The primary goal is to identify customers at high risk of leaving so that proactive retention efforts can be launched.

The core solution involves a Random Forest Classifier model trained on resampled data using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to account for severe class imbalance.

üöÄ Analysis Notebook
The complete, step-by-step analysis, including detailed EDA, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, is available in the following Colab notebook.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps and Findings
1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration
Data Size: The dataset contains 7,043 customer records and 20 features.

Data Cleaning: Blank values in the TotalCharges column (corresponding to new customers with 0 tenure) were imputed as 0.0 and the column was converted to a float data type.

Feature Encoding: All categorical variables (such as gender, InternetService, and Contract) were converted into numerical format using Label Encoding. These encoders are saved for production use (encoders.pkl).

Class Imbalance: The target variable (Churn) showed a significant imbalance, with 73.5% of customers not churning and 26.5% churning.

2. Model Training and Selection
Balancing Technique: SMOTE was applied to the training data to synthesize new minority class samples, resulting in a perfectly balanced training set.

Model Evaluation: Three models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.

Best Model: The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest cross-validation mean accuracy (approximately 84%) on the balanced training data.

3. Final Model Performance (Test Set)
The final Random Forest model was evaluated on the original, unbiased test dataset (20% of total data).

Overall Accuracy: 77.86%

Churn Recall: 0.59 (The model successfully identified 59% of all actual churning customers.)

Churn Precision: 0.58 (Out of all customers predicted to churn, 58% were actually correct.)

Confusion Matrix Summary:

Correctly predicted Non-Churn (TN): 878

False Alarm (Predicted Churn, Actual No Churn) (FP): 158

Missed Churn (Predicted No Churn, Actual Churn) (FN): 154

Correctly predicted Churn (TP): 219
